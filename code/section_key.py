# REVISE
#This section of the code is nessecary for this research because the section of the class in question has to be randomized
#If the section is not randomized it is easy to tell which student is from which because the section divides students up by classes.
#Firstly needs to access the data and seperate the different sections by making them strings and giving value numbers to hold them such as
#sections[1] and close. Next save the file and loads seesion key file and uses isfile to make sure the keyfile exist
#After making sure the file exist the code moves onto loading and once loaded randomizing the section uses while loop
#to keep randomizing sections untill there is a section number that does not exist in the dictionary. The equation is
#(sessionCode * 100 + random.random() * 100)
